This action cancels the currently running workflow.

## Usage ðŸš€

```yaml
permissions:
      actions: write

    steps:
      - name: Cancel workflow
        uses: action-pack/cancel@v1
```

In combination with the ```if``` statement, this allows you to cancel the workflow conditionally:

```yaml
    steps:
      - name: Check condition
        if: env.my_variable == 'true'
        uses: action-pack/cancel@v1
```
